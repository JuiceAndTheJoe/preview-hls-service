## Usage

```
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 eyevinntechnology/hlspreview:<version>
```

Then make an HTTP GET request either to:

```
http://localhost:8000/video?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmaitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology%2FVINN.mp4%2Fmaster.m3u8
```

to generate a video/mp4. Or:

```
http://localhost:8000/image?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmaitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology%2FVINN.mp4%2Fmaster.m3u8
```

to generate an image/png.

The `u` parameter is the urlencoded URL to the HLS.

If you want to choose another position in the HLS you provide the query param `pos` where you specify a position in seconds.
